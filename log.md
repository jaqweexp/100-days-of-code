**Today's Progress**: Started working on more simple projects, starting with a slideshow.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a lot better! Still just doing the basics, but feel like this is a good start in building a good foudation. Made decent progress on remembering everything. Excited to turn the bad boys into a slideshow and style it tomorrow.
